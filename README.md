Key Features:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sensor Fused State Feedback: The software integrates GPS and IMU data using standard sensor fusion techniques to enhance drone localization accuracy and using is to produce reliable feedback.

LQR Controller Exploration: The controller utilizes a basic Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with a simple update based on the drone's yaw angle.

User-Friendly Tuning: Tinker with the controller parameters using a straightforward interface, allowing for basic customization and performance tuning.

Visualization for Understanding: Gain insights into the drone's behavior with simple visualization tools. Basic plots and graphics help illustrate its dynamics, control responses, and sensor fusion outputs.

Plant Model Simplification: The plant model attempts to capture some aspects of nonlinear dynamics and includes basic disturbances for a somewhat realistic simulation.

Mission Planner Experimentation: Plan and simulate drone missions with a basic mission planner. Explore the software's capabilities in different scenarios.

Manual Control Input: Test the quadcopter performance by manually controlling it with a joystick, allowing the filtered state feedback to reveal the capabilities of the quadcopter.
