Drone Dynamics and Localization Software repository. This MATLAB-based project reflects my journey, combining concepts from my Bachelor's in Vehicle Engineering and my Master's in Robotics Systems and Control. It's an exploration into drone dynamics and localization, incorporating techniques for sensor fusion of GPS and IMU data.

Key Features:
Sensor Fusion Simplicity: The software integrates GPS and IMU data using standard sensor fusion techniques to enhance drone localization accuracy.

LQR Controller Exploration: The controller utilizes a basic Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with a simple update based on the drone's yaw angle. It's a modest attempt to optimize control performance.

User-Friendly Tuning: Tinker with the controller parameters using a straightforward interface, allowing for basic customization and performance optimization.

Visualization for Understanding: Gain insights into a drone's behavior with simple visualization tools. Basic plots and graphics help illustrate its dynamics, control responses, and sensor fusion outputs.

Plant Model Simplification: The plant model attempts to capture some aspects of nonlinear dynamics and includes basic disturbances for a somewhat realistic simulation.

Mission Planner Experimentation: Plan and simulate drone missions with a basic mission planner. Explore the software's capabilities in different scenarios.

Humble Note:
This software is a modest attempt to exercise my academic skills. The mission planner is provided to assist users in exploring the software. Feel free to adapt, modify, and experiment with the code, keeping in mind its simplicity and the ongoing learning process.

Your insights, feedback, and contributions are genuinely appreciated. Thank you for exploring this project.
